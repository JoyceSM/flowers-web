# Flowers-web

The main aim of this project is to design a website for a fictitious floriculture shop. The website is designed in a way that two different user roles can perform specific actions on the website. 
Firstly, the admin staff can be able to view, update, and delete a specific product. Lastly, the user can see all products in a responsive design, so that I can access it using a small, medium or large device.

### This application is using:

* Java
- RestAPI
+ JavaScript
* JQuery
- MySQL
+ Bootstrap
